# Shipment Tracking Dashboard (starter)

This starter contains a minimal `index.html` that reads your Google Sheets data via a Google Apps Script Web App.

## How to use

1. In Google Apps Script, deploy your script as **Web App** (Execute as: you; Who has access: *Anyone*). Copy the deployment URL (it ends with `/exec`).

2. Open `index.html` in a text editor and replace:
   ```js
   const WEB_APP_URL = "REPLACE_WITH_YOUR_WEB_APP_URL";
   ```
   with your actual Web App URL.

3. Double‑click `index.html` to open it in your browser and see your live data.

## Optional: Serve locally (VS Code)

- Install the "Live Server" extension.
- Right‑click `index.html` → "Open with Live Server".
